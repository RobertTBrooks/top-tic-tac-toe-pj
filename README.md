Tic-Tac-Toe!

This project was built as part of The Odin Project curriculum.

It’s a hands-on challenge where you're simply given one task:
“Build the game.”

No step-by-step instructions — just the freedom (and frustration!) to figure things out on your own using what you've learned so far.

What I Learned

This might be "just another Tic-Tac-Toe," but it’s my implementation — something I built from scratch by brainstorming, experimenting, breaking things, and fixing them again.

Along the way, I:

    Practiced DOM manipulation and modular JavaScript

    Learned how to structure game logic

    Reinforced debugging and problem-solving skills

    Got a deeper understanding of event-driven code

I did run into a few walls and had to look up some concepts, but the majority of this project came from my own head and hands — and that feels awesome.

Why It Matters

Projects like this push you to think, iterate, and take ownership of your code. It's more than just a tutorial — it's real practice.

Try It Out

Feel free to explore the code, play the game, and let me know what you think!
